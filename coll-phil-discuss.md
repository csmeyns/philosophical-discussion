On several occasions, Collingwood expressed his disapproval of oral philosophical discussion, at least as carried out by his colleagues and contemporaries. At the same time, at some points he makes clear that he does not disapprove of oral philosophical discussion as such. Collingwood seems to conceive of the "right way" of discussing matters philosophical with other people as being part of the proper method of philosophy. (In his autobiography he clearly suggests that he takes there to be a 'right way', and he mentions briefly that he has tried to use it in practice, to little avail.) So how to conduct such discussions fruitfully? 

In _The New Leviathan_ Collingwood highlights Plato's distinction between _eristic_ and _dialectic_. To me it seems clear that here we find a way in to Collingwood's conception of the right way of philosophical discussion. In particular, Collingwood mentions 'academic discussions' as a good example of eristic discussions that exploit the ficticious erection of positions that aren't actually held and cannot ever be defeated (26.22)(see also connely2003aa p. 266, and a recent blog post on the topic). 

As an aside, Collingwood sees the dominance of an eristic form of debate as having political implications (e.g. NL p. 207), this makes sense of his charge that the Oxford Realism of his day paves the way for Facism. (Though, at present it is not entirely clear to me what connection there is between the doctrines of the Oxford Realists and this mode of discussion. One could speculate that Collingwood takes the preferred mode of discussion to be a manifestation of the Oxford Realist commitment that the knower does not affect the known; this is a suggestion that deserves further consideration.)
