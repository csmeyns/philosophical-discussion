\subsection*{Abstract}

This is a paper about a combative style of philosophical discussion, in particular as R.G. Collingwood conceived of it. Collingwood often rejects the methods of specific philosophical schools, yet he is not always clear about his reasons. In this paper I identify Collingwood's conception of two modes of philosophical discussion, and explain how his criticism of one of them flows from his general theory of knowledge. Understanding how he criticized the way philosophers still behave at conferences and in seminars can help us understand better what is wrong with combative styles of philosophy. I suggest Collingwood's arguments aid the increasingly welcomed project of improving the way philosophy is done.

On more than one occasion, Collingwood expressed his disapproval of orally discussing material presented at seminars and at conferences, at least in the way pursued by his colleagues and contemporaries in Oxford. His account in the _Autobiography_ (1939) makes manifest that his rejection of the way his peers discussed philosophy was not widely shared. At the time it met with hostility and scorn. What was Collingwood's criticism?

Collingwood's aversion to discussions aimed at conviction or refutation, or, even worse, general discussions of philosophical ideas, is typically associated with the pages of the _Autobiography_ critical of Oxford Realism. Yet readers of those pages may get the impression that Collingwood's objections are primarily empirical or psychological: when philosophers in oral discussion try to convince others of their views, or try to refute another's view, or more generally speak out for philosophical positions, such intellectual outcries epistemically have little lasting effect on an opponent or audience. This interpretation falls short. Although Collingwood would agree that they in fact have little effect, I suggest he has a more fundamental, systematic reason for dismissing such modes of philosophical discussion. He does not explicate that reason in the _Autobiography_. I argue that for the most explicit statement of Collingwood's verdicts about philosophical discussion we need to turn to _The New Leviathan_ (1942).

In _The New Leviathan_ Collingwood identifies a danger of thinking with false abstractions. He takes academic discussions---discussions aimed at conviction and refutation of 'views' or 'positions'---to fall prey to just that danger. Collingwood exploits Plato's distinction between _eristic_ and _dialectic_. Academic discussions, he thinks, are the best examples of eristic discussions. The problem with eristic discussion, he thinks, is its starting point in abstraction. Collingwood admits that abstraction may be a necessary part of any kind of thinking (_NL_:26.18). But that does not take away that _false abstraction_ is problematic. False abstraction occurs when the two parties in a discussion take themselves (or when a third takes them) to voice mutually independent positions, as if we could conceive their specific views in utter isolation. Such false abstractions presuppose a pernicious use of make-believe or fictional thinking. This is because the 'views' or 'positions' at issue do not exist on their own at all. Collingwood uses the example of a conflict between democratic and aristocratic conceptions of political life. By conceiving of a philosophical dispute as a disagreement between two or more such self-standing views, as philosophers still tend to do, we lose sight of the fact that they are dialectically tied. In other words, in doing so, interlocutors suppress or forget the unity of their intellectual enterprise---they ignore that philosophical discussion aims at solving a particular philosophical problem. I show how Collingwood takes the right way to engage in philosophical discussion to require a mindset that remains weary of such abstraction and shows an interest in the actual problems, thoughts and reasoning of one's interlocutor.

This discussion in _The New Leviathan_ sheds light on the pages of the _Autobiography_. The way his contemporaries discussed philosophy was worthless, Collingwood thought, because they founded their discussion on false abstractions. This is not an empirical or psychological objection, but one based on the interdependence of philosophical ideas and positions. When philosophers start to think of a philosophical position as something they can consider and argue about in isolation the situation is always illusory and always dangerous (_NL_:27.52). Collingwood implies that conceiving of philosophical discussion as having the potential to convince someone of a particular view, or as possibly leading to the refutation of another, already presupposes this kind of dialectical isolation. Any tradition of philosophy that elevates this conception of philosophical discussion to a professional standard or ideal---in the _Autobiography_ Collingwood singles out Oxford Realism---is a tradition that takes part in intellectual history uncomprehendingly (_NL_:27.56).

This line of criticism Collingwood voiced close to a century ago. In recent years an increasing number of philosophers have reached a similarly negative verdict about the typically combative way philosophers engage with one another in seminars and at conferences. Their target of criticism here is a hostile style of discourse that feeds on disagreement, and this is just what Collingwood judged unwelcome. To my mind, the profession as a whole nowadays seems to take these negative attitudes towards combative styles of discussion  increasingly serious. If that is right, then Collingwood's motivations for dismissing such styles of discussion are of interest to wider debates about the right way to practice philosophy. This is in part because Collingwood's specific line of criticism itself paves the way for improvement.

What does Collingwoodâ€™s objection teach us about how we can improve the way philosophy is done? I argue that it can help us overcome a tension. On the one hand, philosophers are increasingly willing to side with Collingwood's dismissal of a combative style of discussion, a style of discussion aimed at conviction or refutation. Yet at the same time they remain unwilling to give up the conception of philosophical disputes as being between 'views' or 'positions'; the alternative, conceiving of philosophical disputes as disputes between particular, historical thinkers, they regard as equally undesirable. Collingwood's arguments force philosophers wanting to improve the way philosophy is done to rethink the nature of philosophical disagreement.
